I unfortunately am not gifted with the ability to design or be creative, so this project was very difficult for me in that regard. I would say I spent 50% of my time trying to make it look decent with colors and fonts and the other 50% actaully building the website.

I believe I was able to solve all the problems I attempted although some of them definelty coulf of been done more DRY.

If I had to redo the whole thing differently I would first get a graphic designer :). I would put everything into folders and make it neat and organized. I didn't realize the importance of that until I was already more than halfway through this project. With a well designed website from the beginning I think I could have made this website a whole lot better, less code, and more organized.
